    <div id="blog_post">According to the personal thinking style quiz that we took online, my two strongest thinking styles are Abstract Sequential and Abstract Random. Abstract Sequential according to Anthony Gregorc is where the learner likes to "analyze situations before a decision" and applies "logic in solving or finding solutions to problems." Abstract random thinkers "listen to others," "bring harmony to group situations," and learn best when able to "participate in group activities." While these descriptions are fairly accurate of my learning style, they aren't always 100% and different situations sometimes require you to adapt different learning styles.<br>
    <br>
    I haven't really thought too much about learning styles so far in Phase 0, but as I reflect on it now, I think the biggest struggle for me so far involves specialty situations. What I mean by that is that in my head I have an idea of how I want my website to look or how I want my code written, but it is something that hasn't been in the reading and it is outside of my knowledge. I rely heavily on google and web searches to find my own answers to things that I don't know for these. For example, earlier this phase, I was researching the inject method for my factorials and looking up best practices for coding a website. I am not sure if there is really any alternative for this learning style yet until I have a more advanced knowledge base. I think being able to seek and answer your own questions is a good trait to have, but as I enter into a team environment, I hope to be able to also reach out to my peers for help too so that I don't get stuck on my own for a long period of time. Working remotely is a challenge that has hindered that aspect so far as it can be sometimes quicker to look up your own questions than to rely on a post to be answered or explain something through email. <br>
    <br>
    So far, I think Phase 0 so far has gone better than expected. I remember being nervous for pair programming thinking that it would be awkward, but it has been more natural than I thought it would be.I think a very rewarding part of pair programming so far has been working with other people and seeing how they approach problems. For some of the exercises that I have done on my own, I am all over the place and might not have the best start. Seeing other people explain their thought process has helped me and over the next weeks I am working to adjust the way I approach my exercises when I work solo. I also have a better sense of time-boxing but it is something I hope to improve on to increase productivity and just have better time management. <br>
    <br>
    One last thing to reflect on is mindset behaviors. I think just by being in DBC I am already working on changing my mindset behavior. When reading on the subject of growth vs. fixed mindset, I can see that most of the world pushes you toward a fixed mindset. I am already pushing myself into areas that reveal my flaws and lack of knowledge because I am learning something new, but just by doing that and challenging myself I am shifting to a new mindset. I think Phase 0 is a great start for that shift, but I know that will only increase as we all begin to work closer together in the next coming weeks. It does make you a little nervous going into a situation where you might not know as much as the other person, but I am learning from it and I think that is the best way you can look at it.</div>
