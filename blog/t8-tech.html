     <p>Let's think of a scenario real quick. You are going on a road trip to Florida. You throw all of your stuff in a suitcase and put it in the back of the car. You start off on your road trip and you decide that you want to get something out of your suitcase...that sucks doesn't it? You have to stop the car, get out and grab whatever it was that was so important to you and bring it up to the front of the car. That seems like a slow process. If you were smart, wouldn't you just have a bag in the front of the car to store things you might need? It would be much faster to get something right next to you then to go all the way to the trunk of the car. You know that. That's why most people do something similar to this.</p>

     <p>In this example, consider yourself as the processor, or CPU. When you want to get something, you have to go to where it is stored. The suitcase would be like the hard drive- it holds all of the information. If you had to go to the suitcase everytime you wanted something, that would take forever (and you would probably never make it to Florida). By adding another bag in the front seat (memory), you can quickly grab the things you need right away. So memory is awesome. It allows our computers to quickly retreive information. </p>

     <p>This example is a little basic and isn't really exact, but it helps you get the idea. Let's dig in just a little bit deeper.</p>

     <p>So far, we understand that memory is a place that stores data that is used by the processor, but there are different types of memory. Think about your own memory- there are things that you need to remember permanantly like your name, and some things that only need to be in your memory temporarily such as the time for a friend's party. When the dinner party is over, you don't really need to know that time anymore. You would probably just erase it from your memory and store something else.</p>

     <p>Much like this example, computers have permanant and temporary storage solutions.</p>

     <h2>RAM (Random Access Memory)</h2>
     <p>Random Access Memory is a temporary storage location. Most RAM is volitile, meaning that it only stores infomation when the computer has power. </p>

     <h2>ROM (Read Only Memory)</h2>
     <p>Read Only Memory is a permanant storage location that operates whether the computer is on or off. ROM stores information vital to the computer booting up, including BIOS settings, start-up programs and system software.</p>

     <p>There is obviously a lot more to computer memory than I have explained here, but hopefully this has been a helpful beginner session to memory.</p>
