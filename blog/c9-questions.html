   <p>I've got a question for you...do you know how to ask a good question? We ask questions all the time throughout the day, but this week's question that Dev Bootcamp asked us is "How do you ask a good question"? Throughout DBC, I've asked myself and other students a lot of questions about coding, but I have never really thought about what makes up a good question. Asking a good question gets you the information you need in a timely manner.</p>

    <p><b>Do your research first</b></p>
    <p>Posting a question on a message board that you can find by a quick google search is just lazy and a waste of other people's time. If you ask a lot of questions that you can find on your own, people will see that you aren't putting any work into the problem and might not help you out. </p>

    <p><b>Is it concise?</b>
    <p>Everyone is busy and has things to do. If you are looking for help, don't waste time with details that aren't important to solving the question. Adding a small rant that doesn't deal with the problem is distracting and might lead to people clicking the back button.</p>

    <p><b>Include all relevant details</b></p>
    <p>While being concise is important, having all of the relevant details is also important. Don't leave out any information that someone would need. If the question is computer related, make sure to include all error logs, screen shots, computer information, and anything else related to your problem or question. </p>

    <p><b>Make it readable</b></p>
    <p>Do whatever you can to make it easier for your reader- that includes using complete sentences and keeping the caps lock off. While typos and spelling errors happen, run spell check and read the question to yourself out loud. If there is any part of the question that isn't clear to you, it probably won't be clear to the reader (you wrote it after all, you should be able to understand it!). </p>

    <p>There may not be such a thing as a dumb question, but there are such things as bad questions. Make sure you are clear, concise and keep it relevant, and you should be on your way to getting the information you want quickly.</p>
