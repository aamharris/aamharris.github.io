      <p>At my previous job, I worked a lot with field maps. I printed off each map as a PDF and put them into folders, so that if other people needed to print them off, they could easily do so. In an effort to make it even easier, I combined a bunch of PDF's into one large one so that they wouldn't have to select multiple files to print. A couple of weeks after I made the combined file, we had a change in field maps. So I changed the individual PDF files but did not update the combined PDF. One of my co-workers printed off the group map to find that they weren't updated and called me into his office at 8 in the morning and went off on me. This was unexpected and I felt very disrespected by him. Even though the mistake was on my end, the interaction was very rude and it set me off too. He continued into my office and we continued to go off on each other until he left. <p>

      <p>Looking back on this event, I can still remember feeling fired up. The more we discussed the issue, the more angry I got. The next day or two around the office was not quite the same. This was someone that I got along with very well prior to this, so it was a little strange. We continued to work with each other, but our conversations were brief. We ended up having a discussion about it after we had some time to cool off where we talked about what happened and gave our respective apologies. </p>

     <p>It is obvious to say that it would be nice to go back in time and have the correct maps, but I know that if I were able to rewind time, I would still have probably forgotten to fix the maps. With that said, I know that there were several ways that I could have handled the situation differently.</p>

     <p>This week in DBC, we're talking about how to manage conflict. An important part in conflict management is to recognize how you feel and why. Think about those feelings and communicate them. In this example, I felt disrespected by the approach this person made. I didn't disagree with my mistakes- they should have been fixed. But instead chewing me out, a simple "Can you correct the maps" would have kept me from getting fired up. But this brings me to another important lesson. When someone raises their voice to you, it doesn't mean that you have to do it back. Even though this is probably a natural instinct, yelling back will not make your case any better or solve the problem. It is still important to communicate how you are feeling, but doing so in a way they would expect to be communicated to you is important. </p>

     <p>I know that during my time at DBC, especially in high stress situations, I will have times where I might feel upset or angry. Reflecting on this story has helped me think about my emotions before I react, so that I don't end up making others feel the same way I felt in this story. </p>
