## Change of Scenery

*In January, I leave my job, my home, and this small town for a complete 180: Dev Bootcamp.*

31 October 2014

From a job where I didn't really need to think, to constantly being challenged; from just getting through the day, to pushing myself to the maximum; from a lot of solo work, to working with a group, there is a lot of change in a short amount of time. I put a lot of time and thought into this decision, and as the days continue at my current job, I know this is the right thing to do.

Even though I have read numerous blogs about Dev Bootcamp, I have no way to tell what I am really getting myself into until I experience it for myself. You can read all the posts you want about previous boots but the experience will be different for everyone. Everyone going into it has some level of excitement and some level of fear. In this short time I have already learned several things through the prep and intro work, and it is just the beginning.

I am excited about is the social aspect of DBC. This is the one thing I miss most about college. You are around a group of people that are around your own age (give or take) and you are all in it to learn. In the working world, the environment was pretty harsh. In my experience people were so protective of their own skills that they would not communicate or teach you anything. It even went as far as badmouthing other people for no reason. I couldn't handle it and I hope that was just a bad experience I can forget about.

I am also very nervous about Dev Bootcamp. I think my biggest fear is failing, and I don't want that to get in the way of confidence. From a video that we watched as part of the intro unit, Shereef mentioned that at some point you will get your ass kicked. To me, it is kind of terrifying that everyone sounds so excited about this. But when he talked about the different mindsets that people have and how you think about things, you just realize that you have to think different than how modern education perceives it. This isn't a competition against others. It is about getting in, getting messy, and learning more about yourself that you didn't know you had in you.
