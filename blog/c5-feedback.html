      <h3>Pairing</h3>
      <p>Pairing was one of the things that I was most nervous about in DBC. When I was watching the videos and reading about it in the pre-phase 0 period, I thought that it would be awkward and I was nervous about being with people that knew way more than me. I also was nervous about the driver/navigator roles and felt that this would also be awkward being in remote locations.</p> 

      <p>After the first pairing session though, I found that the sessions are a lot more natural than I thought they would be. I still keep the agenda in the back of my mind that we were taught at the beginning of DBC: a few minutes of introductions, designating driver/navigator roles, and programming. Minus some technical diffiulties that I have had in a few sessions (sound issues, internet speed issues) pairing has been a pretty smooth process. </p>

      <p>I think the part that is still a little hard for me is the driver/navigator roles. Everyone has a different learning style, and for me, I test a lot as I go. When I am explaining something to my pair, sometimes I'm not sure if the code will work or if I have the syntax right. Normally on my own I would know by testing, but in a pairing session when you are navigating, you don't have your hands on the keyboard and you can't test. I do rely on google a lot in pairing, much like I do in my solo work. I hope that as I become more familiar with ruby, I will be able to depend on my knowlege more and guess and test methods less. With driver/navigator roles, I still think that working in remote locations is a little difficult. Even with apps like stypi where you can edit code as a group, you still need to test it in the terminal, which requires moving your code to sublime, sharing your screen and working through the errors together. This isn't too much of a difficulty, but it is a little less streamlined than I wish it could be. I think that once we are in person, this will be less of a problem. </p>

      <p>Pairing sessions have been a good experience for me so far in DBC. Not only have I been able to get to know some of my cohort mates better, but I am also learning how to work with others in a programming environment. I have been with people from different backgrounds and different experience levels which has also been very beneficial to me. </p>


      <h3>Feedback</h3>
      <p>Part of the pairing experience is learning how to give and receive feedback. From DBC, I have learned that good feedback is actionable, specific and kind.</p>

      <p>The feedback that I have received so far hasn't been really surprising. I think that because I receive feedback after every session, I keep that in the back of my mind as I pair. When a session doesn't go as well as I expect, I am more aware of what is going wrong and think of the feedback that I would give myself. As I go through the session, I also think of feedback that I would give to my pair. </p>
      <p>It is harder to give feedback than I thought it would be. Sometimes I am with people who have a lot more experience than myself and it is hard to think of something for them to improve upon. Sometimes things aren't really clicking and you aren't sure what the issue really is. By having feedback requirements every week, I have been able to practice giving feedback, even in difficult situations. </p>

      <p>Overall, I think feedback is vital to improving yourself and others. It is sometimes hard to accept bad feedback, but it is a very important element in a learning and working environment. </p>
