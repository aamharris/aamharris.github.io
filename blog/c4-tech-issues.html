    	Who would have thought that in an era with smart tv's, smart phones and smart watches that we would be left with a bunch of dumb kids. Ok, that might be a little harsh, but there may be some truth behind that exaggeration. Education has a double edged sword of technology: if you don't teach the kids how to use it, they will never make it in today's society. If you try to teach it to them, they look up cat videos on YouTube. There are a few problems with incorporating technology into the classroom. You may not know much about it, but ask any teacher and they will tell you that getting kids to turn off cell phones or put away electronic devices is just common in today's academic field. While I imagine that whipping out a tablet would make you a very popular person, doing it in a learning environment is distracting and takes time out of learning. <br><br>

		I was a prime example back in college. I used my laptop in class to take notes. There were some classes I wasn't very fond of, and I can tell you that I was not always on my laptop for academic reasons. The sad thing here is that this wasn't just a discration for me I'm sure. Other people who were trying to listen probably got distracted by the bright beacon of my laptop screen at some point and maybe even wondered too if I would win that next ebay auction. If a 20-something can get distracted in an education environment, imagine how the elemenary kids are. <br><br>

		Another argument for issues with technology are that it provides a shortcut to learning and avoids critical thinking. It is unbelievable how many answers you can get off the internet. It is a great resource for those who want to learn a new hobby, do repairs on their house or...well anything. Unfortunately, technology can also hinder the process of learning by doing the same thing. All of this information is availble for students to copy and paste without actually understanding the concepts. <br><br>

		I'm not here to say that technology is bad and ruining kids lives. I don't have any solutions for this problem because kids get distracted with non-technology related things too. We need technology in the classroom as much as the classroom needs technology. The next generations need exposure to technology at an early age and they need to know how it works. They need to get excited about it and get educated about it. But they shouldn't be dependant on it and they shouldn't let it get in the way of learning.
