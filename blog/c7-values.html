    <p> This week in DBC, we are going over values, specifically which ones you have when you are the happiest. There was a pretty hefty list with a lot of examples, and the more I went through, the more I realized how many things are important to me. But just to pick a few, here are some of the values that I think are towards the top of my list (in no particular order):</p>

      <ul>

        <li>CREATIVITY</li>
        <li>CLOSE RELATIONSHIPS</li>
        <li>QUALITY</li>
        <li>NATURE</li>

      </ul>

    <p>All of these values are important to me, but I think that close relationships rank at the top. Throughout our day to day life, we have so many relationships- family, friends and co-workers. Think about all of the people you interact with on a day-to-day basis. Now think about the people that you get advice from, vent to, or can hang out with for ridicoulous amounts of time with without being sick of them...you really filter out a lot of numbers and probably are left with just have a handful of people. Close friendships don't just happen- they form over years and years. They take a lot of work, respect, and understanding to form, and can't be broken with just a few fights. </p>

    <p>As I move on to this new chapter of my life, it is important to not forget what got me here in the first place, which are the values that I listed above. With DBC, time will take a toll on some of these close friendships, as I will have less time to call, talk, or hang out with them. As I get frustrated or discouraged, I think it will be important to look back on these values and take time to talk to a friend or do something else creative to get some relief from stress and maintain what has taken me to this point.</p>
