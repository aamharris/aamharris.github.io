    <p>This week for our cultural blog, we were asked to discuss stereotype threat. It didn't surprise me that when we were going through the research that race was one of the topics. With some of the events going on recently in the media, race and stereotype have become a hot talking point. But race is far from the only stereotype that exists. There are genders, regions, cultures, and so many other stereotypes that at some point, someone has probably experienced some sort of threat. Even though we may think of one as greater than the other, they all impact people with negativity.  </p>

    <p>For me, I'm from a small town. When I talk to people from bigger cities about where I come from, they think of an exaggerated Smalltown USA: one street town with horses, one sheriff and dirt roads. While I would like to think that it doesn't bother me when people make fun of this, I sometimes feel like I am being made smaller because of where I am from. This of course draws in other stereotypes. In my town, where nearly everyone is caucasian, people might accuse me of being racist because our town doesn't have a big culture mix. At work, which is predominately male employed, sometimes I hear about sexism being thrown around. This is all the more reason to be aware of stereotype threat. </p>

    <p>Stereotypes are harmful. They put up walls and close your mind's acceptance to other cultures and beliefs. I think that one of the beautiful things about going to college was being in a mix of different cultures and teaching different ways of thinking. It reminds me of the learning methods we learned at DBC about being open-minded. You can't really grow if you have a fixed mindset, and sterotypes are definitely a fixed mindset.</p>
